PiJ 2023/24 code samples

The usual note of caution applies: please look at the answers to
exercises from the worksheets only *after* you have made a serious
attempt at solution these exercises yourself.

When you look at the answers to exercises, please keep in mind that for
a given programming exercise, there are usually many equally valid
solutions. Thus, only because your code looks different, this does not
mean that it is wrong.

Note: We have attempted to provide answers to worksheets using only
the concepts covered in the module by the corresponding day. As such,
the resulting code may not be ideal Java code, but it tries to provide
answers that make sense without having to look ahead in the notes.
