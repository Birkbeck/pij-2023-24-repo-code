 * PostcodeResult object. This is to have a correspondence to the JSON
 * response data.<p>
 *
 * If you want, you can additionally create a separate class, say
 * NicePostcodeResponse, that has the desired five fields called
 * status, postcode, region, latitude, and longitude as its own fields
 * and that reads the contents from a PostcodeResponse (with getters)
 * in its constructor.
